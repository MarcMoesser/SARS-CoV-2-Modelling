This folder contains all necessary files to run an example covalent docking procedure (found in "example_docking_run") as well as the results of all 540 covalently docked Moonshot compounds and the Pfizer compound PF-7321332.

docked_dlg = all docking log files from 540 cov. docked Moonshot compounds
docking_best_pose = best pose for each of the 540 docked compounds (lowest E pose in highest populated cluster)
all_doced_confs = 3D poses of all 100 generated poses for each docked compound
ligand_alignment = contains the MCS-align script and "inspiration" fragment to Moonshot compound alignment
