# BigDFT Analysis

This directory contains the notebook(s) which have been employed to analyse the calculation results of BigDFT code.
To save space, we include the notebooks employed to generate the figures, without the data.
The complete set of data can be found in the [link](https://gitlab.com/luigigenovese/bigdft-mpro) to the gitlab repository related to the calculations.

The figures are included in the directory, saved in vectorial `.png` format.
